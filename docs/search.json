(But if for some reason you don’t want the results generated by a certain code chunk to be included in the report, set the options for the chunk to hide the output). - When you need to give a verbal response to a question, write your answer in text (with Markdown tags that will format the text correctly in the output file).\nWhen you have finished writing all the necessary text and code chunks in YourNameReport.Rmd, you will knit it into the report you turn in for this exercise. This report will present the results of the computations executed with R, as well as your answers to the questions enumerated below.\nBegin typing the new text and code chunks at the bottom of YourNameReport.Rmd, below the header and two code chunks that appear at the top of the file.

We will treat the values of the variables as quantitative (as opposed to categorical) data. But in fact, the values of these variables do not represent meaningful measurements of any kind. They were made up by a statistician named F. J. Anscombe, specifically for the purpose of illustrating the issues that you will explore in this exercise. The four pairs of variables in this dataset have come to be called “Anscombe’s Quartet.”\nFor this exercise, you will generate some univariate descriptive statistics to compare the distributions of the four X variables and the four Y variables, and calculate simple correlations and regressions to compare the associations between the X and Y variables in the four pairs. In the end you will produce a report in which you present your results and answer some questions that ask you to interpret them. Y ou will produce the report by writing an R Markdown file that contains R code chunks that execute the analyses you need to do, as well as Markdown code that generates the text of your report.\nYou will also construct an electronic “compendium” for this exercise, a folder in which you store the data, the R Markdown file you write, and some additional files that will be explained later in these instructions. The purpose of the compendium is to provide comprehensive documentation of your work that would make it easy for someone else to understand everything you did with the data, and to reproduce both the text and the computational results presented in your report.",

Describe the method used to create the sample, and any additional criteria used to include or exclude any groups of individuals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThis question is about the cleaned and processed data in the analysis.dta file, rather than the original dataset you downloaded from ICPSR. Nonetheless, to answer it you will need to refer to the codebook for the original study. However, you will also need to take into account the processing of the data that you did to create analysis.dta.\n\n\n\nExplain in words what Figure 1 shows. Is that what you would have expected? If not, how does Figure 1 differ from what you expected?\nExplain in words what Figure 2 shows. Does what you see in Figure 2 shed any light on what you saw in Figure 1? Explain.\nHow many individuals are represented in Figure 1? (That is, how many observations did Stata use to generate the figure?) And how many individuals are represented in Figure 2? If the numbers of individuals represented in Figures 1 and 2 are not the same, explain: were some individuals represented in Figure 1 not represented in Figure 2? If so, which individuals were these?

For most of the tasks, your first attempt at writing a command or commands won’t work—you will get error messages, or something will be obviously incorrect, and you will need to try again, maybe several times, before you figure out syntax that works.\nWhen you have finally gotten everything in a do-file to run successfully, you may well have accumulated a lot of extra stuff that is no longer relevant: commands that were first tries, false starts, or exploration to figure out how things work.\nAt the end of the exercise, when you are preparing the final electronic documentation to submit with your printed report, you should clean up your do-files: remove any first tries, false starts and exploration that turned out to be mistakes or that do not serve any purpose. The only commands left in the do-files you submit with your documentation should be ones that do something necessary to accomplish the required tasks.\nAnd remember to include comments throughout your do-files explaining the purpose of the commands at each step of the data processing and analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n\n\nYour do-files of course need to run properly and execute the steps of data processing and analysis that reproduce your results.

The survey focused on alcohol use, but also included questions on many other aspects of college life.\nThis exercise asks you to use the data from the alcohol survey to create a number of bar graphs, and then answer a series of questions about what the bar graphs suggest about patterns of alcohol use among students that live in alcohol-free housing compared to those who do not.\nA critical dimension of this exercise is documenting your work in such a way that everything you do with your data is transparent and reproducible. In this context, that means several things:\n\nWriting do-files containing code that executes every step of data processing and analysis you do to construct the bar graphs—including opening up the file containing the survey data, cleaning and processing the data as necessary, and then generating the bar graphs.\n\nindicate where files that need to be opened are located and where files that need to be stored should be saved.\n\nConstructing a Data Appendix that serves as a codebook or user’s guide to your analysis dataset—the cleaned and processed version of the survey data that you use to generate the bar graphs.\n\n\nWriting a Read Me file that describes the content and organization of the documentation you create for this exercise, and gives step-by-step instructions for using the documentation to replicate all the data processing you did and to reproduce your bar graphs.\n\nWhen you have completed this exercise, you will turn in both a printed report and a set of electronic files you create to document your work.",

Any code or text that you experimented with but that does not serve a purpose in generating the report should be removed.\nBe sure that you have inserted comments generously throughout YourNameReport.Rmd to explain what the code you have written is doing at every step of the exercise.\n\nSecond, be sure that your ./YourNameAnscombeExercise folder contains the following items:\n\nFive files:\n\nAnscombeExercise.Rproj. This file was in the folder when you began this exercise; you should not have modified it.\nYourNameReport.Rmd. This is the source file in which you typed the text and code chunks as described in the instructions above.\nSetup.R. This file was in the folder when you began this exercise; you should not have modified it.\nYourNameReport.html. This is the report in .html format.\nYourNameReport.pdf. This is the report in .pdf format.\n\nOne subfolder:\n\nThe subfolder should be called /Data, and it should contain a file called anscombe.csv. The Data folder is created, and anscombe.csv is downloaded and saved in it, by the R script Setup.R. (Setup.R runs when you knit YourNameReport.Rmd: there is an R chunk in the source file that calls Setup.R.)\n\n\nIf there are any files in ./YourNameAnscombeExercise other than those listed above, you should delete them. In particular:\n\nIf ReportTemplate.Rmd is still the folder, you should remove it.\nIt is possible that some additional files are created when you knit Report.Rmd. If so, you should remove them.\n\nSimilarly, if there are any files in the Data subfolder other than Anscombe.csv, you should delete them.\nYour ./YourNameAnscombeProject folder, containing the items listed above (and nothing else) is your compendium for this exercise.\nThe completed project should look like this:\n./YourNameAnscombeProject\n├── YourNameReport.Rmd\n├── AnscombeExercise.Rproj\n├── Setup.R\n├── YourNameReport.html\n├── YourNameReport.pdf\n└── Data\n    └── anscombe.csv",

Check to be sure that the data printed matches the data listed above in Section 1 of this exercise. \n\nNext write text and code chunks to answer the following questions.\n\n\nQuestion 1\nCompute the means and standard deviations of all eight variables in the dataset. Use R’s round() function to round off the answers to show no more than two digits beyond the decimal point.\nHow do the means and standard deviations of the X variables compare to one another? How do the means and standard deviations of the Y variables compare to one another?\n\n\nQuestion 2\nCompute the correlations between the X and Y variables in each of the four pairs, (X1, Y1), (X2, Y2), (X3, Y3), and (X4, Y4).\nAgain, use R’s round() function to round off the answers to show no more than two digits beyond the decimal point.) point.\nHow do the correlations for the four pairs of variables compare to one another?\n\n\nQuestion 3\nFor each of the four pairs of X and Y variables, compute an ordinary least squares regression, treating the Y variable as the dependent variable and the X variable as the independent variable. Print the estimated intercept and slope from each regression using R’s coefficients() function, specifying the option display=2 to round off the values of the coefficients.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n\n\nHere is R code that will run the regression and display the coefficients as required for the (X1, Y1) regression:\nprint(\"Regression of X1 on Y1: Intercept and Slope\")\nfit1&lt;-lm(anscombe$Y1~anscombe$X1)\nprint(coefficients(fit1), display=2)\nModify this code to compute the regressions with the three other pairs of variables.\n\n\n\nHow do the estimated coefficients from the four regressions compare to one another?\n\n\nQuestion 4\nGiven what you observed in Questions 1, 2, and 3, would you be justified in drawing the following conclusion? Explain why or why not.\n“The association between the X and Y variables is similar for all four pairs.”\n\n\nQuestion 5\nNow let’s supplement the numerical analysis we have done with a very simple visualization. Create four scatterplots, one for each of the four pairs of variables, letting the horizontal axis represent the value of the X variable and the vertical axis represent the value of the Y variable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n\n\nGenerate these scatterplots by using the plot() function four times, once for each pair of variables.\nTo display the four scatterplots as panels in a single frame, type the following line immediately before the four plot() functions:\npar(mfrow = c(2, 2))\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 6\nUsing only correlations and regressions to evaluate the nature of the associations between the X and Y variables failed to reveal some important information that was evident in the scatterplots. Perhaps it would have been useful to look at some additional numerical descriptive statistics—rather than just correlations and regressions. So let’s see what we might learn by looking at some additional numerical statistics. And in addition to looking at some additional statistics, let’s not round off to just two digits beyond the decimal place.\nIn particular, for every X variable and every Y variable, find the mean, standard deviation, mean absolute deviation, 25th percentile, median, and 75th percentile. Use R’s round() function to allow up to 5 digits beyond the decimal point.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n\n\nGenerating the mean absolute deviation for each variable requires using the MeanAD option inside R’s apply() function:\napply(anscombe, 2, MAD)\nWhen you add the round() function to allow up to 5 digits beyond the decimal point, the expression looks like this:\nround(apply(anscombe, 2, MAD),5)\nNote also that the MeanAD option requires the DescTools package, so the code chunk you write for this problem should begin with\nlibrary(DescTools)\n\n\n\nWhat do you learn from these more detailed descriptive statistics that you could not learn from just the means and standard deviations you computed for question 1?\n\n\nQuestion 7\nThis exercise is intended to teach some cautionary lessons about some pitfalls you might encounter when you are trying to get an understanding of the distributions of several variables or investigating the nature of the bivariate associations among the variables. Write a paragraph or two summarizing what you believe are the most important of these lessons.\n\nWhen you have finished writing all the code chunks and text described above in YourNameReport.Rmd, be sure to save the file. Then knit YourNameReport.Rmd to generate your report for this exercise. Because of the output options specified in the header at the beginning of Report.Rmd, knitting the source file will generate the report in both .pdf (YourNameReport.pdf) and .html format (YourNameReport.html.) Both versions of the report will be saved in the top level of the the AnscombeExercise R project.",
