    "text": "Create a set of folders to store your work in\nDecide where you will keep your work. Depending on your preferences and the technology you are using, you may store these folders locally (on the hard disk of a computer you will be using), on a storage server or course management system maintained by your institution, or on-line [using a platform such as the Open Science Framework, Dropbox, or Google Drive].\nIn any case, you should choose a place to store these folders that is secure and that you will be able to access easily while you work on this exercise.\nWherever you store these folders, be sure that there is system in place to automatically back them up, or that you manually maintain an up-to-date set of back-up files at all times.\nCreate your folders. An essential step toward ensuring that your data processing and analysis are easily reproducible is creating a folder hierarchy—a set of folders (and folders-within-folders) with a well-defined structure—in which you store your data, command files, and accompanying documents. You should create this set of folders at the very beginning of your work—before you even obtain the data you will be using.\nYou will keep all your files in these folders while you work on this exercise, and when you have finished you will use them to store the electronic documentation that you submit with your printed report.\n\nCreate the folder hierarchy for this exercise\nMake a new folder with the name Your-Name-Alcohol-Exercise, and save it in the location you chose to save your work in. This will be the main folder in which you store all of your work for this exercise.\nNext create the following folders and sub-folders:\n./Your-Name-Alcohol-Exercise/Original-Data\n./Your-Name-Alcohol-Exercise/Command-Files\n./Your-Name-Alcohol-Exercise/Graphs\nIn the /Graphs folder create the following sub-folders\n/Graphs/For-Data-Appendix\n/Graphs/For-Report\nFinally, in the /Original-Data folder create the following subfolder\n/Original-Data/Metadata\nYour completed folder hierarchy should look like this\n./Your-Name-Alcohol-Exercise/Original-Data/Metadata\n./Your-Name-Alcohol-Exercise/Command-Files\n./Your-Name-Alcohol-Exercise/Graphs/For-Data-Appendix\n./Your-Name-Alcohol-Exercise/Graphs/For-Report\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n\n\nBe sure to build this folder hierarchy before you proceed to the next steps of this exercise. Having these folders set up in advance so that you have a place to put the various files you obtain or create while you work on this exercise will help things go smoothly."

The data used in this exercise come from a study titled Harvard School of Public Health College Alcohol Study, 2001. This study is archived at the Inter-University Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR); its ICPSR study number is 4291.\nGo to the ICPSR website (www.icpsr.umich.edu), and search for this study. When you have found the page for this study, read the information provided there\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n\n\nSome of the information on the webpage for the dataset may have to do with technical matters you don’t understand or details that may not appear important, but that is OK. Just read through the page and get out of it what you can.\n\n\n\n\nDownload the dataset and codebook\nBefore you can download the data, you need to create an account on the ICPSR website. Once you have done so, log in, go to the main page for the 2001 alcohol study, and click on the “Download” button. You will get a menu of formats to choose from, including SAS, SPSS, Stata, and ASCII. From this menu, select Stata.\nThe data file will be downloaded in a zipped folder. When you unzip and look inside the folder, you will see that it contains several documents, as well as a subfolder called /DS0001 For this exercise, you will need to use only two of the files you downloaded, both of which will be stored in the /DS0001 subfolder:\n\n04291-0001-Data.dta This file contains the data from the survey, stored in Stata’s .dta format. This file will be referred to as the “original data file” for this exercise.\n\n\n04291-0001-Codebook.pdf This is the codebook for the 2001 alcohol survey. It will be referred to as the “metadata” for the original data file.\n\nYou should save copies of both of these files in the folder hierarchy you created for this exercise.\nSave the original data file in the /Original-Data folder.\nSave the codebook in the /Metadata folder (which is inside your Original-Data folder).\n\n\nExamine the codebook and dataset\nExamine the codebook and original data file to familiarize yourself with the information they contain.\nIn particular, by reading the codebook and using Stata to explore the contents of the data, answer the following questions:\n\nWhat is the recommended format for citations of this dataset (to use, for example, in a reference list or a list of data sources)?\n\n\nHow many observations are there in the dataset?\n\n\nHow many variables are there in the dataset?\n\n\nWhat is the unit of analysis for the dataset?\n\n\nWhat population was the sample represented in this dataset taken from?\n\nFor this exercise, you will need to use six variables from alcohol study. In the original data file, these variables have the names A6, B8, B9, C13, G6, and G11.\nFor each of these variables, answer the following questions:\n\nHow is the variable defined, or what does it represent?\n\n\nWhat units is the variable measured in, or what is the coding scheme?\n\n\nIs it categorical or quantitative?\n\n\nIf it is quantitative, find the mean, standard deviation, the three quartiles, the minimum and the maximum.\n\n\nIt if is categorical, how many categories are there, what do they represent, and what proportion of the observations fall in each category?\n\n\nFor each categorical variable, decide whether the categories are ordered or unordered\n\nFinally, suppose you wanted know what college or university each student in the sample attended. Would you be able to find that out using the codebook and dataset you downloaded from ICPSR? If so, how would you do so? If not, do you have any idea why that information is not provided?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n\n\nYou will not need to turn in written answers to these questions, and you will not need to turn in do-files that document this preliminary exploration of your data. However, it is important to convince yourself that you understand all of the questions well. If you are hazy on any of them, you are likely to encounter trouble as you work on the parts of the exercise that you do have to turn in."

As you work on this exercise, you will be creating new files of various kinds, and storing them in designated locations in this hierarchy. Whenever you are working with Stata, a copy of your complete folder hierarchy, with the most up-to-date versions of all your files stored in their designated locations, should be saved on the computer you are working on."
