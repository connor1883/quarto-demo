The survey focused on alcohol use, but also included questions on many other aspects of college life.\nThis exercise asks you to use the data from the alcohol survey to create a number of bar graphs, and then answer a series of questions about what the bar graphs suggest about patterns of alcohol use among students that live in alcohol-free housing compared to those who do not.\nA critical dimension of this exercise is documenting your work in such a way that everything you do with your data is transparent and reproducible. In this context, that means several things:\n\nWriting do-files containing code that executes every step of data processing and analysis you do to construct the bar graphs—including opening up the file containing the survey data, cleaning and processing the data as necessary, and then generating the bar graphs.\n\nindicate where files that need to be opened are located and where files that need to be stored should be saved.\n\nConstructing a Data Appendix that serves as a codebook or user’s guide to your analysis dataset—the cleaned and processed version of the survey data that you use to generate the bar graphs.\n\n\nWriting a Read Me file that describes the content and organization of the documentation you create for this exercise, and gives step-by-step instructions for using the documentation to replicate all the data processing you did and to reproduce your bar graphs.\n\nWhen you have completed this exercise, you will turn in both a printed report and a set of electronic files you create to document your work.",

Therefore, drop all cases for which the student’s residence at college is “Off campus house/apt” or “other.” Also, drop all cases for which the variable representing the student’s residence at college has a missing value.\nGenerate a variable called drunk, which is:\n\nequal to 0 if the student drank enough to get drunk fewer than three times in the last thirty days\nequal to 1 if the student drank enough to get drunk three or more times in the last thirty days\nequal to missing (“.”) if the variable indicating how many times the student drank enough to get drunk in the last thirty days is missing\n\nGenerate a variable called hsdrunk, which is:\n\nequal to 0 if the student had five or more drinks in a row on two or fewer occasions during her/his last year of high school\nequal to 1 if the student had five or more drinks in a row on three or more occasions during her/his last year of high school\nequal to missing (“.”) if the variable indicating how many times the student had five or more drinks in a row during her/his last year of high school is missing\n\nGenerate a variable called free, which is:\n\nequal to 0 if the student does not live in alcohol-free housing\nequal to 1 if the student lives in alcohol-free housing\nequal to missing (“.”) if the variable indicating whether or not the student lives in alcohol-free housing is missing\n\nGenerate a variable called volfree, which is:\n\nequal to 1 if free=1 (the student lives in alcohol-free housing) and the student requested to live in alcohol-free housing\nequal to 0 if free=1 (the student lives in alcohol-free housing) and the student was assigned to live in alcohol-free housing\nequal to missing (“.”) in all other cases\n\nGenerate a variable called housing, which is:\n\nequal to 1 if free=0 (the student does not live in alcohol-free housing)\nequal to 2 if free=1 (the student lives in alcohol-free housing) and the student was assigned to live in alcohol-free housing\nequal to 3 if free=1 (the student lives in alcohol-free housing) and all on-campus housing is alcohol-free\nequal to 4 if free=1 (the student lives in alcohol-free housing) and the student requested to live in alcohol-free housing\nequal to missing (“.”) in all other cases\n\nGenerate a new variable that is simply an exact copy of G6, and give it the name health.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n\n\nYou will not use the variable health in this exercise, but in the addendum to this document it is used to illustrate the information that should be provided in the Data Appendix.\n\n\n\n\nDrop all variables other than the six that were just created\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n\n\nIt will be easier to do this using Stata’s keep command than Stata’s drop command.\n\n\n\n\nAssign appropriate labels to each of the six variables.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n\n\nThe variable names you defined when you created the variables (drunk, hsdrunk, etc.) are the ones you will use when you write commands for Stata. The labels you apply to the variables are the ones that will appear in figures and tables that Stata produces. Choose short but descriptive labels. For example, an appropriate label for health would be “Health Rating”.\n\n\n\n\nAssign appropriate labels to the values of each of the six variables. For example, based on information given for the variable G6 in the original data file, appropriate value labels for the variable health would be “Excellent” for the value 1, and “Very Good” for 2, “Good” for 3, “Fair” for 4, and “Poor” for 5.\nDrop all cases for which the value of drunk is missing.\nDrop all cases for which the value of hsdrunk is missing.\nDrop all cases for which the value of housing is missing.\nSave the new data file you have created. This will be your analysis data file—i.e., the fully processed data that you will use to generate the bar graphs for this exercise. Give this analysis data file the name analysis.dta, and save it in your Analysis-Data folder. (Use a relative directory path to specify the location of the Analysis-Data folder.)\n\nRemember to save processing.do in your Command-Files folder.",

Interpretation.” In the body of this section, you should give answers to the following questions:\n\nDescribe the sample in the analysis.dta data file you created. What is the unit of observation? How many observations are there? Describe the method used to create the sample, and any additional criteria used to include or exclude any groups of individuals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThis question is about the cleaned and processed data in the analysis.dta file, rather than the original dataset you downloaded from ICPSR. Nonetheless, to answer it you will need to refer to the codebook for the original study. However, you will also need to take into account the processing of the data that you did to create analysis.dta.\n\n\n\nExplain in words what Figure 1 shows. Is that what you would have expected? If not, how does Figure 1 differ from what you expected?\nExplain in words what Figure 2 shows. Does what you see in Figure 2 shed any light on what you saw in Figure 1? Explain.\nHow many individuals are represented in Figure 1? (That is, how many observations did Stata use to generate the figure?) And how many individuals are represented in Figure 2? If the numbers of individuals represented in Figures 1 and 2 are not the same, explain: were some individuals represented in Figure 1 not represented in Figure 2? If so, which individuals were these? And were some individuals represented in Figure 2 not represented in Figure 1? If so, which individuals were these?\nConsider Figure 3. Which parts of it show information that was already shown in Figures 1 and 2? Which parts of it show new information? Summarize in words what Figure 3 shows.\nCompare Figure 4 to Figure 1. Explain what new information is provided by Figure 4, and give some interpretation.\nCompare Figure 5 to Figure 2. Explain what new information is provided by Figure 4, and give some interpretation.\nCompare Figure 6 to Figure 3. Explain what new information is provided by Figure 4, and give some interpretation.\nFrom the figures you created, what general conclusions can you draw about the factors associated with drinking among college students?",
