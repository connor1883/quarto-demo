    "text": "For this exercise you will write three do files:\n\nprocessing.do\nIn most studies involving statistical data (including this exercise), the original data must be processed before they are ready to be analyzed. For example, this processing may include correcting or removing errors in the original data, dropping variables or observations, generating new variables, and (when your original data are stored in more than one file) combining data files.\nData on which all the processing necessary to prepare them for analysis has been completed are referred to as “analysis data.” These are the data that will be used to generate the results that are presented in the final report on the study. The processing.do do-file you write for this exercise will contain commands that open up the original data file 04291-0001-Data.dta, process the data as necessary to create your analysis data file, and then save the analysis data in a file named analysis.dta.\n\n\ndata-appendix.do\nThe Data Appendix is a document that serves as a codebook or user’s guide for your analysis data. It contains variable definitions, coding and summary statistics (numeric and graphical) for all the variables in your analysis data. The data-appendix.do do-file will contain commands that open up your analysis data file analysis.dtaand then generate the summary statistics and other information that you will include in the Data Appendix.\n\n\nresults.do\nFigures, tables and other information presented in a report about a study that were generated by computations performed on statistical data are referred to as “results.”\nFor this exercise, the results consist of six bar graphs. The results.do do-file will contain commands that open up analysis.dta, and then generate those graphs, saving each graph when it is created.",

    "text": "Revising for markdown publication\nIn this exercise, you will explore whether there is less drinking among college students who live in alcohol-free housing than among students who do not live in alcohol-free housing.\nThe data you will use come from a survey of students at American colleges and universities conducted in 2001. The survey focused on alcohol use, but also included questions on many other aspects of college life.\nThis exercise asks you to use the data from the alcohol survey to create a number of bar graphs, and then answer a series of questions about what the bar graphs suggest about patterns of alcohol use among students that live in alcohol-free housing compared to those who do not.\nA critical dimension of this exercise is documenting your work in such a way that everything you do with your data is transparent and reproducible. In this context, that means several things:\n\nWriting do-files containing code that executes every step of data processing and analysis you do to construct the bar graphs—including opening up the file containing the survey data, cleaning and processing the data as necessary, and then generating the bar graphs.\n\nindicate where files that need to be opened are located and where files that need to be stored should be saved.\n\nConstructing a Data Appendix that serves as a codebook or user’s guide to your analysis dataset—the cleaned and processed version of the survey data that you use to generate the bar graphs.\n\n\nWriting a Read Me file that describes the content and organization of the documentation you create for this exercise, and gives step-by-step instructions for using the documentation to replicate all the data processing you did and to reproduce your bar graphs.\n\nWhen you have completed this exercise, you will turn in both a printed report and a set of electronic files you create to document your work.",

Therefore, drop all cases for which the student’s residence at college is “Off campus house/apt” or “other.” Also, drop all cases for which the variable representing the student’s residence at college has a missing value.\nGenerate a variable called drunk, which is:\n\nequal to 0 if the student drank enough to get drunk fewer than three times in the last thirty days\nequal to 1 if the student drank enough to get drunk three or more times in the last thirty days\nequal to missing (“.”) if the variable indicating how many times the student drank enough to get drunk in the last thirty days is missing\n\nGenerate a variable called hsdrunk, which is:\n\nequal to 0 if the student had five or more drinks in a row on two or fewer occasions during her/his last year of high school\nequal to 1 if the student had five or more drinks in a row on three or more occasions during her/his last year of high school\nequal to missing (“.”) if the variable indicating how many times the student had five or more drinks in a row during her/his last year of high school is missing\n\nGenerate a variable called free, which is:\n\nequal to 0 if the student does not live in alcohol-free housing\nequal to 1 if the student lives in alcohol-free housing\nequal to missing (“.”) if the variable indicating whether or not the student lives in alcohol-free housing is missing\n\nGenerate a variable called volfree, which is:\n\nequal to 1 if free=1 (the student lives in alcohol-free housing) and the student requested to live in alcohol-free housing\nequal to 0 if free=1 (the student lives in alcohol-free housing) and the student was assigned to live in alcohol-free housing\nequal to missing (“.”) in all other cases\n\nGenerate a variable called housing, which is:\n\nequal to 1 if free=0 (the student does not live in alcohol-free housing)\nequal to 2 if free=1 (the student lives in alcohol-free housing) and the student was assigned to live in alcohol-free housing\nequal to 3 if free=1 (the student lives in alcohol-free housing) and all on-campus housing is alcohol-free\nequal to 4 if free=1 (the student lives in alcohol-free housing) and the student requested to live in alcohol-free housing\nequal to missing (“.”) in all other cases\n\nGenerate a new variable that is simply an exact copy of G6, and give it the name health.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n\n\nYou will not use the variable health in this exercise, but in the addendum to this document it is used to illustrate the information that should be provided in the Data Appendix.\n\n\n\n\nDrop all variables other than the six that were just created\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n\n\nIt will be easier to do this using Stata’s keep command than Stata’s drop command.\n\n\n\n\nAssign appropriate labels to each of the six variables.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n\n\nThe variable names you defined when you created the variables (drunk, hsdrunk, etc.) are the ones you will use when you write commands for Stata. The labels you apply to the variables are the ones that will appear in figures and tables that Stata produces. Choose short but descriptive labels. For example, an appropriate label for health would be “Health Rating”.\n\n\n\n\nAssign appropriate labels to the values of each of the six variables. For example, based on information given for the variable G6 in the original data file, appropriate value labels for the variable health would be “Excellent” for the value 1, and “Very Good” for 2, “Good” for 3, “Fair” for 4, and “Poor” for 5.\nDrop all cases for which the value of drunk is missing.\nDrop all cases for which the value of hsdrunk is missing.\nDrop all cases for which the value of housing is missing.\nSave the new data file you have created. This will be your analysis data file—i.e., the fully processed data that you will use to generate the bar graphs for this exercise. Give this analysis data file the name analysis.dta, and save it in your Analysis-Data folder. (Use a relative directory path to specify the location of the Analysis-Data folder.)\n\nRemember to save processing.do in your Command-Files folder.",
