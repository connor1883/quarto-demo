title: "Data Appendix"

This section should begin with the heading "II. Data Appendix." 

The Data Appendix should consist of multiple sections, or “entries,” one for each of the variables in the final data set.

For each variable, the entry in the Data Appendix should give: 

- The name of the variable.

- The number of missing observations, in the format m/n, where m represents the number of missing observations and n represents the total number of observations (missing plus non-missing).

- A definition of the variable.

- The possible values of the variable.

- The coding of the values; i.e., an explanation of what each value of the variable represents.

- A table showing the frequency distribution and the percent frequency distribution.  If the categorical variable is an ordered categorical variable, this table should also show the cumulative percent frequency distribution.
